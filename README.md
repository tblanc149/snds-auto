SNDS Patient Journey Dataset Builder (Automation of Medico-Administrative Tables)

Developed a Python/Pandas workflow to load and harmonize multiple SNDS tables (beneficiaries, ambulatory care, drugs, labs, medical acts, devices, facilities) and merge them with hospitalization data. The tool produces a time-ordered, patient-level event table suitable for care pathway analysis, sequence visualization, and export (e.g., Excel per patient and consolidated outputs). 

Completed as part of a group project.
